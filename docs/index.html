    <h1>Welcome to Craftlogs!</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>What is the "CraftLogs"?</h3>
    <p>It's a Xamarin.Forms(Android only) project for ELTE IK Freshman Camp's Craft game(some kind of LARP).</p>
    <h3>What should I know about this project?</h3>
    <p>I started writing the first version in 2017. We used the application in the 2018 PGT. The source code is stored
        in a private repository on Bitbucket. Version 2.0 will be open source.</p>
    <h3>Differences between CraftLogs 1 and CraftLogs 2</h3>
    <p>The first version ignored every mvvm framework. The code was negligent: "It will be okey like this, just don't be
        buggy!". It was templateable at some level, but not enough. The second version (this) is going to be more
        precise, more structured.</p>
