## CraftLogs


### What is the "CraftLogs"?
It's a Xamarin.Forms(Android only) project for ELTE IK Freshman Camp's Craft game(some kind of LARP).


### What should I know about this project?
I started writing the first version in 2017. We used the application in the 2018 PGT. You can download it from [csigapps.eu](http://csigapps.eu/) and the source code is stored in a private repository on Bitbucket. Version 2.0 will be open source.


### Differences between v1.0.0 and v2.0.0
The first version ignored every mvvm framework. The code was negligent: "It will be okey like this, just don't be buggy!". It was templateable at some level, but not enough. The second version (this) is going to be more precise, more structured.
